 In hashtable while collision occurs:
   -Linear probing: Finds the next available slot(can store data as same the the size of the table, worst case scenario is o(n))
   -Separate chaining will happen(a linked list and more advanced version, balanced tree is formed worst case o(n/k) k= size of hashtable
   -To improve the performance need to use better hash function
